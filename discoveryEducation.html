            <p class="p1">My first challange was to make a tool which mesures the interior angles of a 3D shape and my first questions was what is the interior angle of a 3D shape and I figured out yopu can only find the interior angle of a 2D shape so i had to make a tool to check if the shape drawn is a 2D shape and if it is then you cna trace the shape to find the interior angles, else you can use the lines as vectors and use a formula to find the angle between two vectors in 3D space.</p>

            <p class="p2">My next challange was to create a search feature so users can search for items and spawn them on to the stage. I also had to find a way to acount for miss spellings of words given the app has a target audience of primary school children so I took all the key words froms an XML file and sorted them from closest to least closest but still a possible match to try find what the user is looking for.</p>
