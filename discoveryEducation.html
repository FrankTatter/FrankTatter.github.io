            <p class="p1">My first challenge was to make a tool which measures the interior angles of a 3D shape and my first questions was what is the interior angle of a 3D shape. I figured out you can only find the interior angle of a 2D shape so I had to make a tool to check if the shape drawn is a 2D shape and if it is then you can trace the shape to find the interior angles, else you can use the lines as vectors and use a formula to find the angle between two vectors in 3D space.</p>

I also had to find a way to acount for miss spellings of words given the app has a target audience of primary school children so I took all the key words form an XML file and sorted them from most to least likely results to try find what the user is looking for.</p>
