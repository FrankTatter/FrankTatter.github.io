I figured out you can only find the interior angle of a 2D shape so I had to make a tool to check if the shape drawn is a 2D shape and if it is then you can trace the shape to find the interior angles, else you can use the lines as vectors and use a formula to find the angle between two vectors in 3D space.</p>
