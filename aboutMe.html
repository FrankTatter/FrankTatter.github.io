            <p class="opening">Hi, my name is Frank and I am a sixth form student with a passion for all things software! My journey started in early highschool when I inspected the google homepage and changed the image to a picture of my friend, pretending to be some kind of hacker. Curious as to what else I could do I spent countless hours learning 3D modeling, graphic design, front and back end development to let my creativity run wild!
